## ACHTUNG ACHTUNG ##

Zahlensender is me creating a numbers station Twitter bot - initially simply to create a bot that periodically generates strings of numbers, in order to learn oAuth and actually deploying a Ruby program in the real world.

The eventual aim is to use existing tweets and convert them to code based on various ciphers in order to practice further.

You can follow the bot at https://twitter.com/daszahlensender
