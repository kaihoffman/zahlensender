## ACHTUNG ACHTUNG ##

Zahlensender is me creating a numbers station Twitter bot - initially simply to create a bot that periodically generates strings of numbers, in order to learn oAuth and actually deploying a Ruby program.

The eventual aim is to use existing tweets and convert them to code based on various ciphers in order to practice further.
